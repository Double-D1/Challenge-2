# Challenge-2
In this challenge I was tasked in making a portflio website

# How it functions
the main function of this website is for showing all of the project that I worked on and how to contact me. I also programmed other functions so that it is was usable on other devices. Lastly, I programed buttons to take you else where on the page and hover ineractions with images so that one may now it is clickable.
